# 🐢 Turtle Race Game - Python Mini Project

A fun, interactive turtle race game built using Python's `turtle` graphics module!  
Choose your turtle, watch the countdown, and see if your color wins the race! 🎯

## 🎮 How It Works

- The game launches a simple racing track with 6 turtles (each a different color).
- The user is prompted to place a bet by entering the color they think will win.
- The race begins with a countdown and ends when the first turtle crosses the finish line.
- A message pops up announcing the winning turtle and whether the user guessed right!
